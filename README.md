### Background

This website offers an option for users to create their user account, view their details, view previous orders, and so on.  
It has everything that a normal user website should have from a user point of view. A ‘STORE’ page that will contain all merchandise a band has to offer.  
As a music band, item categories fall under clothing, accessories, and digital/physical media so it will not be too diverse.  
The ‘TOUR’ section shall have all the events related to band’s events like tour dates, cities, countries, and a link to a Ticketmaster site.
